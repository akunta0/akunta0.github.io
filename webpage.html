    </h3>
    <p>
      The series follows Meredith Grey, the daughter of an esteemed general surgeon named Ellis Grey, following her acceptance into the residency program at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, (later named Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital). During her time as a resident, Grey works alongside fellow physicians Cristina Yang, Izzie Stevens, Alex Karev, and George O'Malley, who each struggle to balance their personal lives with hectic schedules and stressful residency requirements. During their internship, they are overseen by Miranda Bailey, a senior resident who works with attending physician Derek Shepherd, head of neurosurgery and Meredith's love interest; Preston Burke, head of cardiology, who becomes Yang's fiance; and Richard Webber, Chief of Surgery and attending general surgeon, the previous lover of Ellis Grey. During the first six seasons, Burke, O'Malley, and Stevens all depart the series.
